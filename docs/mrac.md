I found these resources to be useful learning MRAC.

[What Is Model Reference Adaptive Control (MRAC)?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBBXZXmb8UE), basic introduction video on MRAC by MATLAB describing the basic ideas and equations.

[MathWorks: Model Reference Adaptive Control](https://mathworks.com/help/slcontrol/ug/model-reference-adaptive-control.html), quick reference of the most relevant equations.

[Control: Model Reference Adaptive Control (Lectures on Advanced Control Systems)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJirJeLM6a0) and
[Control: State and Output Feedback Control of Linear Systems (Lectures on Advanced Control Systems)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWeFxseU6g4).
More depth than previous resources. 

[Comparative Analysis of Adaptive Control Techniques for Improved Robust Performance](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=Comparative+Analysis+of+Adaptive+Control+Techniques+for+Improved+Robust+Performance), very extensive description/comparison of different control systems and their problems.
