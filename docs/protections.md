The following protections are implemented:

* Input over/under voltage protection, shuts off the signal 
if power supply malfunctions.
* Over-current protection, shuts off signal generation if any 
of the current sensors detect current above the configured limits.

The following are ideas, not current implemented:

* Watchdog timer.
* Board temperature.
* Electrode disconnect.
