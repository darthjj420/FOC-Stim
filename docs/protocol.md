# Signal generation parameters

FOC-Stim uses the [T-Code](https://github.com/multiaxis/TCode-Specification) protocol for receiving commands. See source code for available axis and ranges.

# Boot process

Once the device is ready to accept commands, it will print `"Device ready. Awaiting DSTART.\r\n"`.

Send `DSTART` to start pulse generation, `DSTOP` to stop.

Version string can be received with `D0`. It is highly recommended to check for an exact version string.

# Logs

The device will regularly send metrics, for example electrode resistance or device temperature information. Logs start with `$` and end with a newline. Example logline `$R_a:1.5 R_b:2.0 V_BUS:42\r\n`.

If an error occurs, unformatted debug information is printed. Errors can only be recovered by restarting the device.

These metrics are defined:

* `R_neutral`, `R_left`, `R_right`: estimated circuit resistance in ohm. Subtract the inductor and transformer resistance and multipy with the square of the winding ratio to get the skin resistance.
* `L`: estimated inductance in ÂµH.
* `rms_neutral`, `rms_left`, `rms_right`: RMS current. Divide by the winding ratio to get the RMS current delivered to the skin.
* `V_bus`: power supply input voltage.
* `V_drive`: actual voltage used to drive the circuit. Limited to about 80% of `V_bus`.
* `F_pulse`: actual pulse frequency.
* `F_mrac`:  control frequency.
* `temp`: temperature of the onboard NTC in degrees celsius.

# Keepalive

The device will stop generating pulses if no valid commands have been received for some time. Spam `DPING` or any other valid command to subvert.
